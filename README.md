Covert Cash Conversion Ceremony
===============================

This is a ceremony which allows for high-latency mixing of bitcoins without needing to trust the mix operator. The mix operator does not have the ability to de-anonymize participants, nor to make off with the funds to be mixed. The operator could perhaps make off with the fee without mixing, but there is little incentive for this.

This idea began with an explanation by gmaxwell on #bitcoin-dev. The meme spread to me via [@wiretapped](https://twitter.com/wiretapped).
